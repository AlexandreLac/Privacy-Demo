# Privacy-Demo
This repository show a small example project using the Privacy alongside the Tag Module from Commanders Act

You can read the specific documentations:

[for iOS](iOS/README.md)

[for Android](Android/README.md)

For both applications we have a tab doing 2 things. When you open it, it will log a "consentView" which is used to log when a user simply viewed your consent page.
Then an "on/off" button will let you enable or disable your privacy.

Since it's only for testing purpose, we don't give this page the current status of the privacy, so you'll always have the button on the off position when you open the app.
